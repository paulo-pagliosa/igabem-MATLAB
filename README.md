# igabem-MATLAB

MATLAB code for isogeometric boundary element analysis of elastic solids modeled by watertight boundary representation forms.

The code is a complementary material of the paper:

M.A. Peres, G. Sanches, A. Paiva, P. Pagliosa, Parallel isogeometric boundary element analysis
with T-splines on CUDA, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering (2024). Accepted for publication.

## Examples, data files and scripts

Coming soon.
